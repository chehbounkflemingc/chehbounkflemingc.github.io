					</header>
					<div class="content">
						<p><strong>Wilfrid Laurier requires an indoor building map application for the campus</strong> Our team will be exploring various platforms to build an indoor building map. The application must offer the functionality required which are an indoor tracking capability, lowest time to build, and intuitivity/ interactivity.</p>
						<p> Here is the the Problem Statement:
						<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
							<li><strong>Ideal</strong>:  Visitors arriving in the Arts Building at Wilfrid Laurier building knowing their whereabouts and can make an educated decision for themselves about how to get to where they need to go.</li>
							<li><strong> Reality </strong>: Not all visitors are familiar with the building and map service/directory may be insufficient and has low accessibility.</li>
							<li><strong>Consequences</strong>:Visitors may be lost and not able to reach their destination efficiently.</li>
							<li><strong>Proposal</strong>: Develop a online indoor map directory of the Arts Building that shows the layout of each floor and all of the rooms on that floor.</li>

						<h2>Introduction</h2>
					</header>
					<div class="content">
						<p>It is challenging to find a way to your destination at Wilfrid Laurier University (WLU)'s Waterloo campus. The locations of buildings 
							are often unclear, some entrances and exits might be very well hidden and some buildings simply do not have an entrance directly 
							into that building. Even the directions inside a building could be confusing due to insufficient of directory signs and indoor maps. 
							A clear indoor map that could be accessed anytime and anywhere would be a helpful solution for this problem.  The purpose of this 
							project is experimenting various Esri products to evaluate their performance and suitability as a indoor map implementation for 
							visitors to the campus. The WLU Arts Building is used as the example of test subject in this project.</p>

								<p> The following steps is how to create a Experience Builder with your data: </p>
								<p>	1. Share your data of interest as Hosted Feature Layers to ArcGIS Online. In this project case, it would be 1st, 2nd, 3rd floor and entrances or exits of the WLU Arts Building. </p>
								<p>	2. Create a web map with the uploaded data in ArcGIS online. Make neccessary edits such as modifying symbology, creating labels and configuring pop-up messages.  </p>
								<p>	3. Create a new Experience Builder project and choose a visualizing template that fits your project. </p>
								<p>	4. Drag and drop the Map widget into the canvas to show your webmap created in previous steps, insert other neccessary widgets such as Query, Legend, Table and more to 
									   customize your web app. </p>
								<p>	5. Publish to the web when it is ready. </p>

						<p> As we ventured into Experience Builder, we tried to indivually test each criteria to see how effective it is at each task to weigh them against each other.</p>
						<div class="content">
						<h3> <u>Indoor Tracking </u></h3>
					<p> Experience Builder has a built-in tracking feature, however the accuracy is far too low for indoor environment. 				</p>
					</div>
			<div class="content">
						<h3> <u>Time to Build </u></h3>
						
						<p> Since Experience Builder does not require programing knowledge, building a project is not time consuming. 
							Interactive widgets are created with drag-and-drop method, and configurations of widgets are simple and straight forward.
							However, the number of widgets available can be overwhelming and it can be challenging to determine which one to use for specific tasks.
							Formatting the layout can also be somewhat "finicky" and configuring a complex layout to work well on a mobile device can be challenging. 
							In addition, because Experience Builder uses pre-configured maps, rather than layers that are configured within Experience Builder itself,
							any significan edits to the underlying map can cause the created app (or "Experience") to break.</p>
						<div class="content">
						<h3> <u>Intuitivity / Interactivity </u></h3>	
							<p> Experience Builder is very interactive with users. It has many interactive widgets for users to input. One example is querying data, 
								users are able to search a specific data from attribute tables. </p>
						<h4> <u>Mobile capability</u></h4>
							<p>Although the Experience Builder project can be access by the website through phone, it does not have a mobile phone app.</p>	
						<h5> <u>Offline capability</u></h5>	
							<p>Does not work in offline environment.</p>

						<div class="content">
						<h3> <u>Indoor Tracking </u></h3>
					<p> Workforce does have a built in tracker for mobile users, dispatchers are able to track mobile users.
						However the performance of tracking is poor, there is a huge lag between mobile users sending his location 
					    and	dispatchers recieving the location signal. Also its accuracy is low for indoor environment.	</p>
					</div>
			<div class="content">
						<h3> <u>Time to Build </u></h3>
						
						<p> Creating projects in Workforce using the web app is very simple	and involves only a few steps. The most time-consuming part is setting up 
							the maps that will be seen by the dispatchers (using the web app) and the mobile users (using the mobile app), but even this is not particularly onerous. 
							Creating the maps involves adding the necessary layers and setting up the symbology, labels, zoom levels, etc. for each layer that will be seen in each 
							version of the app (the maps must be set up separately).</p>
						<div class="content">
						<h3> <u>Intuitivity/ Interactivity </u></h3>	
							<p> Dispatcher / desktop side: Low interactivity, the only available information about the indoor map is the pop-up message
							from the rooms.	 </p>
							<p> Worker / mobile side: </p>
						<h4> <u>Mobile capability</u></h4>
							<p> Workforce does have a mobile app available for both IOS and Andriod system.</p>
						<h5> <u>Offline capability</u></h5>	
							<p>Workforce mobile app requires internet service to log in and render the map. </p>

						<h3>ArcGIS Workforce</h3>
							<h3>Pros</h3>

						<h2>Conclusion</h2>
							
						<p><strong> Workforce is not a preferable software for indoor mapping. 
							  		Its lack of query function make it less ideal as a mapping service. 
									The assignment feature is not very relevant for indoor mapping as well, which may only cause 
									confusion for users. Overall it is not designed for indoor mapping purpose.</strong></p>

						<h2>Conclusion</h2>
							
						<p><strong> As a indoor map service, Field Maps has many nice-to-have features such as higher positioning accuracy, offline capability
									and data collecting capability. However it lacks the core feature for indoor mapping service, which is data query,
								    i.e. room searching feature. For people unfamiliar with the campus, a querying function is a higher priority for indoor mapping service,
									this gives Field Maps a slight disadvantage compared to other Esri product that have a data query

							<h2>Our Selected Solution</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
						
						<p> After testing each software and evaluating their performance, there is no clear answer of which Esri product is most suitable for 
							implementing indoor maps. Experience Builder has the most interactivity with user, easiest to use and a very useful querying feature, however it 
						    does not have a proper mobile app and it does not work in an offline environment. Despite the other two products, ArcGIS Workforce and ArcGIS Field Maps, having 
							mobile apps and even offline capability, they lack the data query ability, which is critical for any user who is not familiar with the campus.
						    Overall, Experience Builder has the most advantage for implementing indoor mapping service, but more exploration and research is suggested.  </p>
